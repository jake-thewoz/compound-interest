# compound-interest

This project is a single CPP file which I made to help me calculate long-term financial goals.

If we operate under the assumption that returns from an investment (ie index funds) have a somewhat constant interest rate over time, this tool allows you to calculate the total gains.

Unlike other interest calculators, this one allows the user to enter:
   1. An initial fund
   2. A monthly deposit rate
